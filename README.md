# MBCET Slip App
#### For all your MBCET slip needs

### Created by GDSC MBCET community as part of project for Compose Camp hosted by Google India.

## Reason behind the app
In our college Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology (MBCET), 
the process of getting permission for anything and everything from going back home 
early from college to getting a duplicate ID card involves a tedious process of 
getting a slip from the front desk, filling it, taking it to class advisors to get
signed, and then taking it to department HOD to get signed. And this is cause for
much distress for the students. Therefore we thought this would be a good chance to 
build a sample solution tackling that particular problem.

## Future Scope
Right now there exists only the frontend for the app. Maybe in the future we could 
develop the backend too. Also in the future could add new features to the app like
a TimeTable screen or even Assignments and Marks tracking.
